Week 1,"Discover why USD and Solaris are essential for efficient lighting workflows-from core terminology and scene structure to geometry, materials, cinematic lighting principles, storytelling techniques, and rendering in Solaris.",https://rebelway.academy/lessons/week1-52/
Week 2,"Dive into USD layers and composition arcs to see how data is organized, master color management, automate material setups, explore exporting strategies, leverage variants, optimize assets with proxy geometry, and configure payloads in Solaris.",https://rebelway.academy/lessons/week2-52/
Week 3,"Master USD kinds and component builder workflows: compare Houdini-default asset template, customize node structures, choose referencing vs. grafting strategies, understand inheritance and arc strength, save asset templates, and export a sample cruiser.",https://rebelway.academy/lessons/week3-76/
Week 4,"Build a project asset gallery and automate USD pipelines-from TOPs-driven loops and kitbash processing to BMS library workflows-then set up triplanar shading, primvar-driven materials, procedural instancing shaders, and turntable exports.",https://rebelway.academy/lessons/week4-75/
Week 5,"Establish cinematic composition and stage organization: select references that make shots pop, keep your stage tidy with presets, manage native and point instancing for USD efficiency, apply basic animation constraints, survey layout tools, and deploy quick ‚Äòlazy‚Äô lighting.",https://rebelway.academy/lessons/week5-36/
Week 6,"Add final polish with fog details, VDB volume integration, ocean procedural effects, and lighting tweaks; dive into sampling theory for noise removal, test render sequences, configure render settings/AOVs, and coordinate multi-artist USD workflows.",https://rebelway.academy/lessons/week6-36/
Week 7,"Prepare and light CG to footage: capture essential on-set data, integrate Nuke toolsets for plate prep, align 3D scenes accurately, and apply both Karma and Arnold lighting techniques using spatial and storytelling principles.",https://rebelway.academy/lessons/week7-37/
Week 8,"Tackle minimal-reference lighting challenges: light with little info, analyze sequences for reusable elements, match multi-light plates, balance realism vs. aesthetics, use particles with motion blur, auto-generate Arnold light groups, loop Solaris primitives, and reuse shot USD.",https://rebelway.academy/lessons/week8-36/
Week 9,"Scale your sequence lighting: develop hero shots to guide child shots, build single-artist master projects and multi-artist previs pipelines, and leverage context options to control USD outputs across a full CG sequence.",https://rebelway.academy/lessons/week9-20/
Week 10,"Composite and polish all major class shots in Nuke: integrate USD geometry via the scene graph, project cameras, craft lens imperfection recipes, utilize AOVs for accurate motion blur, match grain, blend shadow passes, and master basic keying workflows.",https://rebelway.academy/lessons/week10-15/
