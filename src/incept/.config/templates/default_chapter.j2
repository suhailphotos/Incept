{# 
  This template defines the folder structure for a chapter.
  - The final chapter folder will be named: "<chapter_prefix>_<chapter_name>"
  - It contains subfolders for assignments, lessons, and materials.
  - It also creates a file named notes.md.
  - The variable `lessons` is expected to be a list of lesson objects (each rendered via the lesson template).
