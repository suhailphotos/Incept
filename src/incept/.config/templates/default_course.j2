{# 
  This template defines the folder structure for a course.
  - The final course folder will be named: "<course_prefix>_<course_name>"
  - It contains subfolders for assets, chapters, course_materials, and videos.
  - It also creates files like notion_sync.json and progress.md.
  - The variable `chapters` is expected to be a list of chapter objects (each rendered via the chapter template).
